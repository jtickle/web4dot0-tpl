Web4.0 Project Template
=======================

I hated the buzzwordy "web version numbers" but when you think about it, it does
go through major iterations over time.  Everyone copies each other until someone
has a newer, faster, cheaper, more secure way of doing it; and then everyone
copies that, and so on.

So here is a project template to make Web 4.0 sites.  Too bad we skipped over
3.0 and never got around to doing that whole "Semantic Web" thing very well.
Web 4.0 sites (really, applications) operate like you think of Facebook and
Google.  The whole website ends up being a client-side app, either literally on
mobile or figuratively in a web browser.  It acts on its own with local storage,
but when it can, it communicates with the server regarding updates.

The uncommented dependencies in package.json are the minimal set for this sort
of thing.  The rest of the commented out libraries are my preferences for
optional functionality.  But don't just include everything, only include
something if you need it.
